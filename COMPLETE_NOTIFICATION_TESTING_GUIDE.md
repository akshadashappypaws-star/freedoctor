## üîç Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Console Debug Messages
- ‚úÖ "Echo initialized successfully" - WebSocket working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Echo not available - starting polling" - Fallback mode

- Verify Echo initialization messages
- Test with polling routes directly

**2. WebSocket Connection Failed**
- Pusher credentials correct in .env
- BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher set
- Network/firewall blocking connections

**3. Polling Not Working**
- Routes returning proper JSON
- jQuery loaded correctly
- 15-second interval active

### Manual Verification Commands

```bash
# Check notification counts
curl http://localhost:8000/test/notifications/check-all

# Test doctor notification endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/doctor/notifications/check-new

# Test user notification endpoint  
curl http://localhost:8000/user/notifications/check-new
```
