SQLSTATE[01000]: Warning: 1265 Data truncated for column 'camp_request_type' at row 1

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Database Migration**: Updated enum to include all form values
2. **Form Fix**: Corrected case sensitivity (Surgical → surgical)
3. **Migration Executed**: ✅ Successfully ran migration

### **Fixed Values:**
```php
// OLD ENUM: enum('medical','surgical')
// NEW ENUM: enum('medical','surgical','preventive','specialized')

// FORM VALUES FIXED:
'medical' → 'General Medical Screening'
'surgical' → 'Surgical Consultation Camp' ✅ (fixed case)
'preventive' → 'Preventive Health Checkup' ✅ (added to enum)
'specialized' → 'Specialized Health Camp' ✅ (added to enum)
```
